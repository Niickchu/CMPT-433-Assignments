# CMPT-433-Assignments

## Note: These projects were developed for usage with a BeagleBone Green and the necessary hardware peripherals

**Assignment 1: Reaction Time** \
A simple reaction speed test implemented using onboard buttons and LEDs.

**Assignment 2: Light Sampler** \
An analysis program that samples the current light level in the room using a photo-resistor and output statistics to the terminal as well as an 8x8 LED matrix.

**Assignment 3: Beatbox** \
An audiomixer, capable of playing multiple custom user created beats, as well as 3 custom soundbites in realtime at the touch of a button. Control over the volume and tempo of the beat is realized through a joystick.

**Assignment 4: Morse Code** \
A program that converts text from user input and converts it to morse code to be displayed on an 8x8 LED matrix and a singular LED. Code is run on a bare-metal Programmable Realtime Unit (PRU), and data is shared between multiple processors.
